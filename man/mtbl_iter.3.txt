== NAME ==

mtbl_iter - iterate over a sequence of key-value pairs

== SYNOPSIS ==

^#include <mtbl.h>^

[verse]
^mtbl_res
mtbl_iter_next(struct mtbl_iter *'it',
        const uint8_t \**'key', size_t *'len_key',
        const uint8_t **'val', size_t *'len_val');^

[verse]
^void
mtbl_iter_destroy(struct mtbl_iter **'it');^

[verse]
^mtbl_res
mtbl_iter_seek(struct mtbl_iter *'it',
        const uint8_t **'key', size_t *'len_key');^

== DESCRIPTION ==

The ^mtbl_iter^ interface is used to return a sequence of one or more key-value
pairs. Once the caller obtains an ^mtbl_iter^ object, ^mtbl_iter_next^() should
be repeatedly called on it until there are no more key-value entries to
retrieve, at which point the iterator object must be freed by calling
^mtbl_iter_destroy^(). ^mtbl_iter_seek^() can be called on the iterator to seek
to a different location in the index without having to destroy the iterator
and create a new one.

== RETURN VALUE ==

^mtbl_iter_next^() returns ^mtbl_res_success^ if a key-value entry was
successfully retrieved, in which case _key_ and _val_ will point to buffers of
length _len_key_ and _len_val_ respectively. The value ^mtbl_res_failure^ is
returned if there are no more entries to read, or if the _it_ argument is NULL.
