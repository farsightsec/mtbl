== NAME ==

mtbl_dump - print key-value entries from an MTBL file

== SYNOPSIS ==

^mtbl_dump^ ['-s'] ['-x'] 'FILE'

== DESCRIPTION ==

^mtbl_dump^(1) prints all key-value entries from an MTBL file to stdout, in
file order.

By default, each entry is printed on its own line, with double quotes
surrounding the key and the value, with a single space character separating
the two. Unprintable characters and embedded double quote characters are
escaped using the Python string literal syntax.

With the ^-x^ option, each entry is printed on its own line, formatted
as an 8 digit hex length, colon, the hex digit pairs separated by a
dash, for each of the key and value.  Examples:

[verse]
^0000006:00-02-61-63-08-64 00000003:f2-e9-e4^
^00000004:03-01-2d-00 00000000:^



== OPTIONS ==

^-s^::
    Silent mode (don't output anything). Useful for benchmarking.

^-x^::
    Use hex mode output, described above.
