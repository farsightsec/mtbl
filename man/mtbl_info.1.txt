== NAME ==

mtbl_info - display information about an MTBL file

== SYNOPSIS ==

^mtbl_info^ 'FILE' ['FILE']...

== DESCRIPTION ==

^mtbl_info^(1) displays the following information about the MTBL files
specified on the command line.

'file name' -- the name of the MTBL file.

'file size' -- the total size of the MTBL file, in bytes.

'index bytes' -- the total number of bytes and proportion of the total file
size consumed by the index.

'data block bytes' -- the total number of bytes and proportion of the total
file size consumed by data blocks.

'data block size' -- the maximum size of an uncompressed data block.

'data block count' -- the total number of data blocks.

'entry count' -- the total number of key-value entries.

'key bytes' -- the total number of bytes that all keys in the file would
occupy if stored end-to-end in a byte array with no delimiters.

'value bytes' -- the total number of bytes that all values in the file would
occupy if stored end-to-end in a byte array with no delimiters.

'compression algorithm' -- the algorithm used to compress data blocks.
Possible values are "none", "snappy", "zlib", "lz4", and "lz4hc".

'compactness' -- a rough metric comparing the total number of bytes in the
key-value entries with the total size of the MTBL file. It is calculated as
(file size) / (key bytes + value bytes), and thus takes into account the gains
of data block compression and prefix key compression against the overhead of
the index, metadata, and data block offset arrays.
